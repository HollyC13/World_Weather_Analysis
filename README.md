Module 6 - World Weather Analysis

This module covered the use of API keys to collect and analyze data.  Keys were used to obtain data from Google's Maps and Places API, Google's Maps Directions API, and the OpenWeatherMap API.  Geographical and weather data were used to create dataframes and layer maps showing location, weather conditions and maximum temperatures in exercises based on using weather data as a means of picking vacation locations.
